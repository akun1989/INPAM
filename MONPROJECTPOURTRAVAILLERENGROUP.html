    Hello,welcome to the world of Git!
   </head>
<body>In here,you will find the cheet sheer of Git!

<h2>I.What is Git?</h2>

 <p> Git is a distributed revision control system with an emphasis on speed,data 
integrity,and support for distributed,non-linear workflows.
 <p> Git was initially designed and developed by linus Torvalds for Lunix kernel
development in 2005,and has since become the most widely adopted version controlsystem for software development.

<h2>II.Design</h2>
   
 <p>  Git's design was inspired by BitKeeper and Monotone.Git was originally des-igned as a low-level version control system engine on top of which others could write front ends,such as Cogito or StGIT. The core Git project has become a com-plete version control system that is usable directly.While strongly influenced byBitKeeper,Torvalds deliberately avoided conventional approaches,leading to a u-nique design.
 <h3> II.1 Characteristics</h3>
  <p> Git's design is a synthesis of Torvald's experience with Linux in maintaininga large distributed development project,along with his initimate knowledge of fi-le system performance gained from the same project and the urgent need to produ-ce a working system in short order.These influences led to the following implem-entation choices:
  <h4> II.1.1Strong support for non-linear development</h4>
  <h4> II.1.2Distributed development</h4>
  <h4> II.1.3Compatibility with existing systems/protocols</h4>
  <h4> II.1.4Efficient handling of large projects</h4>
  <h4> II.1.5Crytographic authentication of history</h4>
  <h4> II.1.6Toolkit-based design</h4>
  <h4> II.1.7pluggable merge strategies</h4>
  <h4> II.1.8Garbage accumulates unless collected</h4>
  <h4> II.1.9Periodic explicit objet packing</h4>

  <h3> II.2Data structures</h3>
  <p> Git's primitives are not inherently a source code management(SCM)system.
  <p> Torvalds explains,
  <p> In many ways you can just see git as a filesystem -it is content-addressable,and it has a notion of versioning,but I really really designed it coming at the problem from the viewpoint of a filesystem person(hey,kernels is what I do),and I actually have absolutely zero interest in creating a traditional SCM system.

<h2>III.The command frequently of Git</h2>
   <p> git config
   <p> git add
   <p> git commit
   <p> git diff
   <p> git status
   <p> git log
   <p> git relog
   <p> git remote 
   <p> git checkout
<h2>IV.How work in group?</h2>
   <p> I use two computers for write a document on .html
   <p> I want to realize "git diff","git clone","git push","git add","git config", "git commit","git merge"....

   <p> Thanks for git! It make me work so happy!
    

   <p> I finish my work as soon as fast.
