Hello,welcome to the world of Git!
In here,you will find the cheet sheer of Git!

I.What is Git?

   Git is a distributed revision control system with an emphasis on speed,data 
integrity,and support for distributed,non-linear workflows.
   Git was initially designed and developed by linus Torvalds for Lunix kernel
development in 2005,and has since become the most widely adopted version controlsystem for software development.

II.Design
   
   Git's design was inspired by BitKeeper and Monotone.Git was originally design-ed as a low-level version control system engine on top of which others could wr-ite front ends,such as Cogito or StGIT. The core Git project has become a compl-ete version control system that is usable directly.While strongly influenced byBitKeeper,Torvalds deliberately avoided conventional approaches,leading to a uni-que design.
   II.1 Characteristics
   Git's design is a synthesis of Torvald's experience with Linux in maintaininga large distributed development project,along with his initimate knowledge of fi-le system performance gained from the same project and the urgent need to produ-ce a working system in short order.These influences led to the following implem-entation choices:
   II.1.1Strong support for non-linear development
   II.1.2Distributed development
   II.1.3Compatibility with existing systems/protocols
   II.1.4Efficient handling of large projects
   II.1.5Crytographic authentication of history
   II.1.6Toolkit-based design
   II.1.7pluggable merge strategies
   II.1.8Garbage accumulates unless collected
   II.1.9Periodic explicit objet packing

   II.2Data structures
   Git's primitives are not inherently a source code management(SCM)system.
   Torvalds explains,

III.The command frequently of Git
    git config
    git add
    git commit
    git diff
IV.How work in group?
